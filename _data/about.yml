  I'm a software engineer in Python, and I've been self-learning the language for half-year now.
  Before that I've taken multiple courses online on computer-science subjects. I build my own path,
  covering various technology related subjects.
  I've decided to document my studies, as I summary subjects or interesting challenges
  I encounter. Someone might find it useful. The community helps me a lot through
  my journey, and the purpose of this blog is to try give something back to the community.

  I got the inspiration from the multiple blogs I see lately. This blog runs on
  Jekyll (using *[Atum-rb][a]* theme). I have no experience in Ruby, CSS, HTML or any web-related
  language at the time of this writing, so all of this is something new for me.

  This blog is a pile of things I encounter on my learning endeavors. When I'm learning
  something new, or find a good question on [stackoverflow][1] I can't answer, I dig to the bones
  of the subject and summary it for myself. I decided to share my 'homework' on this blog,
  as it might help others plus the benefit of having it all tracked on one place.
